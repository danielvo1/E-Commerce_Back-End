# E-Commerce_Back-End
I was tasked to create multiple api calls through different routes to allow the user to filter through an ecommerce database. The user should be able to request for all data, request for data based on ID, update data, create data, and delete data. 

## Technologies Used 
The application comes with npm packages such as dotenv, express, mysql, and sequelize. The user must run an npm install in order to download the packages onto their local machine. 

The application does not have a client side interface, and is strictly ran through javascript files. 

Insomnia application was used to make the api calls.

## Setup
The code had starter code. Given the code, I was responsible for creating the different models, creating api route calls, and make the connection to the server in order to see the api calls. 

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, users first have to run the db schema.sql file to create the database. After the user must populate the data using the seeds, by runing npm run seed.
